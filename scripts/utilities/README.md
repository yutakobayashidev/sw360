# Utilities

This folder contains utility scripts which implement the database schema changes.

The scripts are written in `python2` and depend on `python2-couchdb`. The couchdb has to run and be accessible on `localhost:5984`.

To execute it is recommended to do this in the following order:
1. ensure that couchdb is accessible (try to open `http://localhost:5984/_utils/`)
2. run the utility scripts (i.e. for each script call `python2 /PATH/TO/00?_some_utility_script.py`)
    * be aware that some scripts are using an internal dry-run switch which you have to change manually in the script's code
